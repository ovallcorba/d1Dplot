# d1Dplot

d1Dplot is a plotting program for 1D X-ray diffraction (XRD) data (i.e. powder diffraction patterns). Its main purposes are to be user friendly, to provide specific tools for XRD data processing/analysis and the possibility to generate nice plots and figures for publications or reports.

Detailed information can be found in the [users guide](d1Dplot_userguide.pdf) or in the publication ["XRD data visualization, processing and analysis with d1Dplot and d2Dplot software packages" *Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute Proceedings* 62 (1), 9](https://www.mdpi.com/2504-3900/62/1/9)

d1Dplot was a personal closed source project started on 2015 and actively maintained until 2020. From August 2022 the program is open source and licensed under the GPL-3.0 license. Sorry if the code is not compliant with standards, is a little bit messy and contains comments in catalan.
